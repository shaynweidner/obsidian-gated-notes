# Gated Notes üß†

**AI-powered, gated reading and spaced repetition for Obsidian.**

**Gated Notes** is an Obsidian plugin that transforms reading into an active learning process. Inspired by [Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen‚Äôs concept of the ‚ÄúMnemonic Medium‚Äù](https://numinous.productions/ttft/#introducing-mnemonic-medium), it combines **gated reading** with an **SM-2 spaced repetition system** and **AI-driven flashcard generation**.

Instead of passively consuming information, you must _earn_ your way through a note: later sections remain blurred until you‚Äôve correctly answered flashcards tied to earlier sections.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Gated Reading:** Locks later paragraphs in a note until you‚Äôve mastered the flashcards for the current section. When you unlock new content, the plugin **automatically scrolls to the next contentful paragraph and highlights it**.

-   **üìö PDF & EPUB Conversion (Experimental):**
    -   Import PDF or EPUB files directly into Obsidian.
    -   Use an AI to convert the raw text into well-structured, clean markdown notes.
    -   Provide an example note to guide the AI's formatting and structure.
    -   For EPUBs, select specific chapters or sections from the table of contents to include.

-   **üí∞ LLM Cost Estimation & Logging:**
    -   See an **estimated cost** for any AI action *before* you run it.
    -   The plugin keeps a log of all AI API calls, allowing you to track your token usage and spending over time.

-   **üñºÔ∏è Multimodal AI:**
    -   **Contextual Image Analysis:** Automatically analyzes images, using surrounding text to understand diagrams, charts, and photos. It extracts key facts and context, not just visual elements.
    -   **Smarter Card Generation:** Creates flashcards that test factual knowledge *from* diagrams (`key_facts`) or ask visual questions that require seeing the image.
    -   **Intelligent Tagging:** Links image-based cards directly to the source image for quick context-jumping.

-   **ü§ñ Advanced AI Tools:**
    -   **Post-Generation Review:** After generating new cards, you're prompted to immediately review, edit, or delete them in a streamlined workflow.
    -   **Custom Guidance:** Direct the AI during card generation with specific instructions (e.g., "the answer (back) should only be names of people and places or dates").
    -   **Split Card:** Break a complex card into smaller, more atomic ones.
    -   **Refocus Card:** Generate alternate phrasings or "reverse" questions for the same fact.
    -   **Auto-Correct Tags:** If the AI generates a tag that isn't a direct quote, it will automatically attempt to fix it.

-   **üóÇÔ∏è Powerful Card Management:**
    -   **Stateful Card Browser:** The browser remembers your scroll position, expanded folders, and last-viewed chapter between sessions.
    -   **Flag Cards:** Mark cards with a üö© to easily find and filter them in the Card Browser.
    -   **Suspend Cards:** Temporarily remove cards from review queues and content gating without deleting them.
    -   **Reset Card Progress:** Reset individual cards back to "new" from the edit modal.
    -   **Card Preview:** See how your Markdown will render on the front and back of a card, right from the edit modal.

-   **üóìÔ∏è SM-2 Scheduling:** Built-in spaced repetition ensures maximum retention.

-   **Multiple Study Modes:**
    -   **üéØ Chapter Mode:** Review cards for the current chapter in gated reading.
    -   **üìö Subject Mode:** Review all cards in a subject folder.
    -   **üß† Review Mode:** Study all due cards vault-wide.

## üöÄ Core Workflow

### 1. Write or Import Notes

-   **Write:** Treat each note as a ‚Äúchapter.‚Äù Write normally in Markdown.
-   **Import:** Use the `Convert PDF to Note` or `Convert EPUB to Note` commands to have an AI generate a structured note from an external file.

### 2. Finalize the Chapter

Prepare the note for gating by converting paragraphs into trackable units. The process uses a markdown-friendly `---GATED-NOTES-SPLIT---` marker.

-   **Auto Finalize:**
    -   `Gated Notes: Finalize note (auto-paragraphs)` ‚Äî Splits on double newlines. If manual split markers are detected, you'll be prompted to choose which method to use.
-   **Manual Finalize:**
    -   Insert split markers (`Mod+Shift+Enter`) where you want breaks, then run `Gated Notes: Finalize note (manual splits)`.
    -   Use `Gated Notes: Remove all manual split tags...` to clean up a note.

### 3. Generate or Add Cards

-   **AI Generation:**
    -   `Gated Notes: Generate flashcards from finalized note` ‚Äî The AI will read the entire note to create cards.
    -   After generation, you'll be prompted to **review the new cards** one by one to ensure quality.
-   **Manual Creation:**
    -   Highlight text ‚Üí right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdd flashcard (manual)‚Äù or use one of the "Generate with AI" options for targeted creation.

### 4. Study to Unlock Content

-   Open a gated note ‚Äî only the first section is visible.
-   Start a review in **Chapter Mode**.
-   As you answer correctly, the next section automatically unblurs and the view scrolls to it. When you fail a card, you can instantly jump to the source text or image to review.
