# Gated Notes üß†

**AI-powered, gated reading and spaced repetition for Obsidian.**

**Gated Notes** is an Obsidian plugin that transforms reading into an active learning process. Inspired by [Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen‚Äôs concept of the ‚ÄúMnemonic Medium‚Äù](https://numinous.productions/ttft/#introducing-mnemonic-medium), it combines **gated reading** with an **SM-2 spaced repetition system** and **AI-driven flashcard generation**.

Instead of passively consuming information, you must _earn_ your way through a note: later sections remain blurred until you‚Äôve correctly answered flashcards tied to earlier sections.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Gated Reading:** Locks later paragraphs in a note until you‚Äôve mastered the flashcards for the current section. When you unlock new content, the plugin **automatically scrolls to the next contentful paragraph and highlights it**.

-   **üìö Advanced PDF & EPUB Conversion:**
    -   **üìÑ Interactive PDF Editor:** A brand new post-conversion workflow for perfect notes, featuring a live markdown editor, side-by-side image management (placement, rotation, stitching), and a tool to capture missing images directly from the PDF.
    -   **‚ö° 2-Phase PDF Processing:** An evolution of the "Nuclear Option" that uses a two-phase approach (per-page multimodal analysis followed by a final reconciliation pass) for unparalleled accuracy.
    -   **‚úÇÔ∏è Universal Snipping Tool:** Capture images from anywhere: from your clipboard, a file, or snip a region directly from a PDF to add to your notes.
    -   **üßπ Unused Image Cleaner:** A new command to scan your vault and find/delete unreferenced images to save space.
    -   **EPUB Import:** Convert EPUB files directly into Obsidian notes, selecting specific chapters or sections from the table of contents to include.
    -   **Structural & Custom Guidance:** Provide an example note to guide the AI's formatting or direct it with specific instructions (e.g., "Summarize key points," "Focus only on definitions").

-   **üí∞ LLM Cost Estimation & Logging:**
    -   See an **estimated cost** for any AI action *before* you run it, with support for complex scenarios like multi-pass hybrid PDF processing.

## üöÄ Core Workflow

### 1. Write or Import Notes

-   **Write:** Treat each note as a ‚Äúchapter.‚Äù Write normally in Markdown.
-   **Import:** Use the `Convert PDF to Note` or `Convert EPUB to Note` commands to have an AI generate a structured note from an external file.

### 2. Finalize the Note

Prepare the note for gating by converting paragraphs into trackable units. The process uses a markdown-friendly `---GATED-NOTES-SPLIT---` marker.

-   **Auto Finalize:**
    -   `Gated Notes: Finalize note (auto-paragraphs)` ‚Äî Splits on double newlines. If manual split markers are detected, you'll be prompted to choose which method to use.
-   **Manual Finalize:**
    -   Insert split markers (`Mod+Shift+Enter`) where you want breaks, then run `Gated Notes: Finalize note (manual splits)`.
    -   Use `Gated Notes: Remove all manual split tags...` to clean up a note.

### 3. Generate or Add Cards

-   **AI Generation:**
    -   `Gated Notes: Generate flashcards from finalized note` ‚Äî The AI will read the entire note to create cards.
    -   After generation, you'll be prompted to **review the new cards** one by one to ensure quality.
-   **Manual Creation:**
    -   Highlight text ‚Üí right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdd flashcard (manual)‚Äù or use one of the "Generate with AI" options for targeted creation.

### 4. Study to Unlock Content

-   Open a gated note ‚Äî only the first section is visible.
-   Start a review in **Note Mode**.
-   As you answer correctly, the next section automatically unblurs and the view scrolls to it. When you fail a card, you can instantly jump to the source text or image to review.
