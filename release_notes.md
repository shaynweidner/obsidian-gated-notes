# v2.5.0

## ‚ú® New Release: The PDF Power-Up Update! ‚ú®

This release introduces a massive overhaul of the PDF-to-Note conversion workflow, adding powerful new tools for context, quality control, and image handling to achieve near-perfect conversions with minimal manual effort.

### üöÄ New Features

-   **‚ö° PDF Nuclear Option:** A new, high-quality processing mode for PDF conversion. It uses a 4-pass pipeline (Minimal Context -> Validation -> Deduplication -> Final Review) to produce exceptionally clean and accurate notes, virtually eliminating common AI conversion errors. *Warning: This option is token-intensive and will have a higher API cost.*
-   **üñºÔ∏è PDF Image Extractor & Placement Assistant:** After converting a PDF, the plugin now automatically extracts all images. A new modal opens, showing the extracted images side-by-side with your generated note, allowing you to easily click and place the correct images into `![IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER]` slots.
-   **üß† Multi-Page Context for PDF Conversion:** The hybrid PDF converter can now use previous and future pages as context when processing the current page. This dramatically improves continuity, reduces repeated headers, and correctly handles paragraphs that span across pages.

### ‚ú® Improvements

-   **Background Image Preloading:** When you select a PDF in the conversion modal, the plugin now starts rendering page images in the background, making the final conversion step feel much faster.
-   **More Robust Image Extraction:** The underlying logic for extracting images from PDF files has been significantly improved to capture more images reliably.
-   **Smarter Example Note Processing:** The logic for abbreviating example notes has been enhanced to better preserve the structure of lists and other complex formatting.

### üîß Technical Changes

-   The internal `sendToLlm` function now supports sending an array of images in a single API call to facilitate the new multi-page context feature.
-   

# v2.4.1

Fixed bug whereby review cards were not shown during Chapter Focus mode, only new cards.

# v2.4.0

### üöÄ Summary

This release introduces a major enhancement to the PDF conversion feature with a new **Hybrid Mode** and **Custom AI Guidance**, providing vastly improved accuracy and control for documents with complex layouts. The underlying AI interaction logic has also been made more robust to handle a wider range of API responses and network conditions.

### ‚ú® New Features

-   **Enhanced PDF to Note Conversion:**
    -   **New "Hybrid" Mode:** You can now choose to process PDFs page-by-page, sending an image of each page along with its extracted text to a vision-capable AI model (like GPT-4o). This is ideal for academic papers, textbooks, and other documents where text extraction alone fails.
    -   **New Custom AI Guidance:** You can now provide specific, free-form text instructions to the AI within the PDF conversion modal to tailor the output to your needs (e.g., "Summarize each section," "Extract all definitions").
    -   **New Post-Processing Step:** An optional AI-powered cleanup pass can now reconstruct the document, intelligently merging paragraphs that were split across pages and removing repetitive page headers/footers.
    -   **Fine-Grained Controls:** The PDF modal now includes options to specify page ranges, image rendering quality (DPI), and max image width.
-   **Advanced Cost Estimation:** The cost estimator is now more intelligent, providing accurate estimates for complex multi-page hybrid PDF conversions before you commit.

### üîß Improvements & Fixes

-   **Robust JSON Parsing:** The logic for parsing responses from the AI has been significantly improved with multiple fallbacks and error-correction heuristics, making card generation more reliable.
-   **Reliable API Requests:** The plugin now uses a custom adapter for OpenAI API calls that leverages Obsidian's native `requestUrl` function, which can improve reliability in some network environments.
-   **Improved AI Prompts:** The prompts used for AI-assisted card "Refocus" and "Split" actions have been refined with better examples and clearer instructions to improve the quality of the results.

# v2.3.0

This version introduces major new experimental features for content creation, a comprehensive system for managing AI costs, and significant workflow enhancements that give users more control over the AI generation process.

### ‚ú® New Features

-   **PDF & EPUB Conversion (Experimental):** You can now convert PDF and EPUB files directly into structured markdown notes. The plugin uses an AI to process the content, with options to provide an example note for formatting guidance and to select specific chapters from EPUB files.
-   **LLM Cost Estimation & Logging:** To provide transparency and control over API usage, the plugin now shows an estimated cost for every AI action *before* you confirm it. A new log file (`_llm_log.json`) is created in your vault root to track all API calls, models used, token counts, and associated costs.

### ü§ñ AI & Workflow Enhancements

-   **Post-Generation Review:** After the AI generates new cards, you are now prompted to review them in a sequential editing modal. This allows you to quickly edit, approve, or delete each card to ensure high quality before they enter your study queue.
-   **More Powerful AI Tools:** The "Refocus" and "Split Card" AI actions are now more powerful, with new options to prevent the creation of duplicate cards. The entire flow now uses a confirmation step that displays the estimated cost.
-   **New Markdown Split Marker:** The old HTML-based split marker has been replaced with a cleaner, more robust `---GATED-NOTES-SPLIT---` marker, improving the finalization and editing process.

### üîß Technical Improvements & Fixes

-   **Upgraded API Integration:** The plugin now uses the official OpenAI SDK for all API communication, leading to improved reliability, better error handling, and more accurate token usage data.
-   **Smarter Highlighting & Scrolling:** The "jump to context" feature is more reliable and provides clearer visual feedback with distinct highlight colors. When content is unlocked, the plugin now intelligently scrolls past empty paragraphs to the next piece of actual content.
-   **Improved Robustness:** JSON parsing from the AI is now more resilient, successfully handling a wider range of formatting quirks from different models.

# v2.2.0

## Gated Notes: Smarter Reviews & A Better Browser!

# v2.1.0

## Gated Notes 2.1.0: Smarter AI, Better Reviews, and More Control

This release is a major step forward, focusing on giving you more control over your cards and making the AI and review process significantly smarter and smoother.

### ‚ú® New Features

* **Flag & Suspend Cards**: You can now flag cards (üö©) for future attention or suspend them (‚è∏Ô∏è) to temporarily remove them from reviews and content gating without deletion. Manage these states from the review modal, the edit screen, or the updated Card Browser.
* **Custom AI Guidance**: When generating cards, you can now provide custom instructions to the AI (e.g., "the answer (back) should only be names of people and places or dates") to tailor the output to your exact needs.
* **Card Preview in Editor**: The card edit modal now has a "Preview" tab, so you can see exactly how your Markdown will render before saving.
* **Reset Chapter Progress**: A new command allows you to reset the entire review history for a chapter, setting all its cards back to "new" without having to delete and regenerate them.

### üöÄ Enhancements

* **Smarter Image Analysis**: The AI now uses the text surrounding an image as context, leading to much more accurate and relevant analysis of diagrams, charts, and photos. It's now focused on extracting `key_facts` that are perfect for flashcards.
* **More Intelligent Card Generation**: The AI prompt has been overhauled to generate more diverse and useful cards, including:
    * Cards that test factual knowledge extracted directly from diagrams.
    * "Visual questions" that require you to see the image to answer.
* **Seamless Content Unlocking**: The review flow is now much smoother. When you answer cards correctly and unlock a new paragraph, the plugin will automatically scroll to and highlight the newly revealed content.
* **Improved Card Browser**: The browser can now filter to show only flagged or suspended cards, making it easy to manage your collection.
* **Better AI "Refocus"**: The prompt for the "Refocus with AI" feature has been improved to generate more accurate "reverse" cards.
